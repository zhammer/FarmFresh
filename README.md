# Farm Fresh

Farm Fresh is a functional mock UI for a service that would allow users to order quality local ingredients online. I initially designed the basic UI as part of an assignment for Jeff Huang's User Interface class at Brown. I built this mockup in React.js mainly to become more familiar with the React framework and web development as a whole.

# Search Functionality
Ingredients can either be searched directly by name – 'lobster' – or by category – '#seafood'. Keep in mind the database is very small and is simply written as a javascript file.

# To Run
Clone the repo to a local directory. Once in the dir, run "npm install" then "npm run start". Webpack should load and the app will be accessible at localhost:8080.

# Todo
I'm interested in learning Flux/Redux and Firebase. Hopefully soon I'll be able to implement cart-viewing, which I imagine would be a good opportunity to use Flux. I'd also like to move the DB from javascript to Firebase. The current structure of the DB would work great with Firebase's NoSQL setup.

# Thanks
Special thanks to @TylerMcGinnis for his webcourse in React: https://online.reacttraining.com/p/reactjsfundamentals. The starting course is free; there are others with Firebase and Redux and Immutable JS listed on the site as well.
Also thanks to my brother for helping me out in converting the JS to ES6 early on and understanding basic React principles.
